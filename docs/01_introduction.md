# Introduction

So nice you take your time to prepare our joint workshop. We will rather
quickly get down in the weeds, so it's important for you to have everything
setup. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have problems with the following
setup.

1. Please install both tools `docker` and `podman`.
   1. MacOS: You will need [Docker
      Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). For
      podman see the [official installation
      instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation#macos)
   1. For Ubuntu and alike: It's enough to have [the docker
      engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) ready for use. For
      podman see the [official installation
      instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation#macos)
1. We will also learn docker compose. So please get this one ready as well.
   **Make sure to have it installed as a docker plugin and not standalone!** So
   the command should be invoked by `docker compose version` not
   `docker-compose version` (mind the dash)
    1. MacOS: Docker Desktop includes the docker compose plugin. So you are
       already good to go!
    1. Ubuntu and alike: See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/ for
       step by step manuals!
1. The podman counterpart to `docker compose` is `podman-compose`. Install this
   tool, too! The neccessary steps are found at
   https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
1. If you have not already, please create an account at
   [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) and run `docker login` This will
   prevent us from running into technical problems during the on site workshop.

Awesome! We are all set!

Please read the [Guide](#) and I am looking forward to our workshop!
